SYSADMIN -> Allcrew@seegnet.kin. RE: Emergency Meltdown proceedures. ` The nuclear reactor is an inherently safe engine, however this does not mean it is foolproof. Dilligence will mean the difference between having a safe, reliable power output which can last for decades, and a nuclear hellfire. `What to do during a meltdown: `-A reactor will melt down when the fission inside it produces an uncontrollable amount of heat (in excess of 810 degrees celsius). If this ever happens, a stationwide alarm will sound. If you hear this alarm, you must act quickly and calmly, as you will have approximately 1 - 2 minutes before the reactor explodes. `-To avert meltdown, simply locate the control console, and choose the 'SCRAM' setting (the button labelled AZ-5). This will immediately lower all control rods and attempt to cool the reactor. Injection of carbon dioxide via the moderator line will help this process. `-In the event of damaged control rods, IMMEDIATELY shut off all supply pumps, filters and evacuate the engineering section IMMEDIATELY to prevent unecessary loss of life. `-As a meltdown occurs, nuclear fuel is deposited all over the station, and must be cleaned up with a shovel. This spent fuel is HIGHLY radioactive, and must be handled with extreme care. If the unthinkable comes to pass, instruct crew to seek shelter in maintenance. To avoid complications, it is recommended that engineers equip radiation proof suits and gas masks, and proceed to clear a path to the evacuation arm with shovels. Remember: Stay safe through vigilance!
