SYSADMIN - > security@frontier.infolink.kin Defensive Gear and You ` Sometimes, situations may call for a more defensive approach, especially when asset protection is kept in-mind. Layenia has access to some light defensive armaments within the station; it is not equipped with defensive battery cannons on the exterior. ` ` Barrier grenade ` These grenades are capable of deploying a barrier on it's location after explosion. The barrier itself cannot be clambered over, and can take quite a beating before it goes down. Effective for narrowing passageways. ` ` Portable flasher ` A bulky unit which can be bolted to the floor with a wrench, and will flash any fast-moving personnel within it's radius. Will not flash if people are walking by it. ` ` Security holobarrier projector ` A handheld device which can project a hardlight barrier- three total- at a location of choosing. It can be dispelled easily with the same device as well.
